I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Under the supervision of [Jugal Garg](http://jugal.ise.illinois.edu/), I work on Fair Division problems in Algorithmic Game Theory and Approximation Algortihms.

I currently am an Operations Research intern at [Norfolk Southern Corp](http://www.nscorp.com/).
